# GitHub Setup Instructions

## After creating your GitHub repository:

Run these commands in your terminal (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username if different from `ist89`):

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/ist89/website.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## If you used a different repository name:

Replace `website` in the URL with your repository name:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/ist89/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

## Verify the push:

After pushing, visit: https://github.com/ist89/website (or your repo URL)

Your code should now be on GitHub!
